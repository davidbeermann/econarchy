INSTRUCTIONS // 

Save the world + the whales once and for all from the megalomanic clutches of Consumegood Inc. ! 

Make your way to the top of the corporation's headquarters and secure the econarchy flag of righteousness.. You can scale the building by jumping onto the platforms but be wary to avoid rousing the attention of the Consumegood henchmen who will bring your covert operation to a pre-mature end. Once you have secured the econarchy flag, launch your parachute and float back to Mother Earth being careful to avoid the jutting platforms upon your descent.

CONTROLS:

a = move left
w = jump up
d = move right
s = move down

OR

arrow keys up, down, right, left to jump up, move down, right and left.
